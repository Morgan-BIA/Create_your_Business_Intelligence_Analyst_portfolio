# Create your Business Intelligence Analyst portfolio

<h1>I. Context</h1>

Several poles compose the ESN. Divided by business segment (aeronautics, healthcare…)

In each pole, commercial managers develop their own business revenue.

To develop their business revenue, they call upon skills of consultants to carry out missions.

An opportunity has offer to me within an international team for a project who will start in 2 weeks.

This mission for a major aeronautics manufacturer will last 4 months and several trips across Europe are expected.

The mission consist to optimize the supply chain with their suppliers. It will be necessary to analyze data and create dashboards for the logistics management teams. 

To apply for this post, I'll need to create a dashboard to assess and provide proofs of my skills. I will also have to create a portfolio to highlight projects already completed.
